            Hi, I am Emre, I live in Turkey and I am 28 years old. My front-end
            developer career began almost one year ago. In fact, I got a
            graduate of education faculty from Ã‡ukurova University which is a
            prestigious university of our country.

            I think I am highly talented in React and UI design. However there
            is much more things to learn for me. While I am coding, I pay
            attention Clean Code Principles and creating reusable modules.In my
            opinion programming is like an ocean and I am just little fish, so
            there are many places I could discover. Bye ðŸ‘‹,
          </p>
